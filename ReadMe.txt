Week Three - Password Assignment

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a password generator using various skills learned in the following weeks. The aim of the project was to have a program that 
spat out a completely random password based off of the user inputs (character length, symbols,numbers,etc). This task was designed to teach us how to use user inputs to 
manipulate the code accordingly.

In this task, i got a lot of help from the classmates, which i really appreciated concidering the catch up i had to do, as a result, my program may look and feel like others,
however, through the course of my own research as well as the classmates help, I got a greater understanding of what these functions, (lines of code) were doing and why.
