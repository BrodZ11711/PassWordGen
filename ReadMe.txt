Week Three - Password Assignment

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a password generator using various skills learned in the following weeks. The aim of the project was to have a program that 
spat out a completely random password based off of the user inputs (character length, symbols,numbers,etc). This task was designed to teach us how to use user inputs to 
manipulate the code accordingly.

In this task, i got a lot of help from the classmates, which i really appreciated concidering the catch up i had to do, as a result, my program may look and feel like others,
however, through the course of my own research as well as the classmates help, I got a greater understanding of what these functions, (lines of code) were doing and why.

[EDIT] After being flagged, I went back to the drawing board, I then watched about 2-3 hours worth of YouTube of various people creating a password generator,
to try and understand it more. Which was actually amazing, because I learnt various differnt codes, from a For Loop
and how it functions, Arrays and doing subArrays, to everything in between. I know I wont get as much marks on this as i kind of went off script.
This version doesn't include and prompts and I know that was a big criteria, however, I still have user inouts, which 
I feel would be more please and user-friendly. I wanted to create a button that would copy the outputted password, however,
it wasnt working for me, and I need to move on in order to catch up with homework.
